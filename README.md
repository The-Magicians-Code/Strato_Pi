## Full-Stack application for controlling motor load machine with StratoPi
System page consists of three categories:
- System control
- Documentation
- Live feed

## For developers
1. Folders and items in [`myproject`](/myproject/) folder contain code that has been tested and are deployed to the server each time the [`./reinit.sh`](/myproject/reinit.sh) is being run  
2. Folders [`Frontend`](Frontend/) and [`Backend`](Backend/) outside the `myproject` folder are meant for pre-production code uploads and testing, back-end and front-end devs upload their code there, which in turn are being merged into the production environment, then integrated into the server.  
3. Strato Pi drivers are found [here](https://github.com/sfera-labs?q=strato-pi&type=all&language=&sort=)  

Contact [Tanel](https://github.com/The-Magicians-Code) for further details or questions  
> All code in this repository is functional (but might blow up upon being wrongly used), further documentation is still being added
